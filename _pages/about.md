My first name pronunciation is “Shaw”.

I will start my Economics Ph.D. at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in the fall of 2024.

My research interests are categorized into three parts:
Part One: Investigating Household Choices. How families change their decision-making when exogenous shocks hit, particularly within the confines of established social norms? My focus is to examine the long-term effects on the behaviors of specific demographic segments.

Part Two: Assessing Policy Impact. My research extends to evaluating the actual effects of policies using advanced textual analysis methods. I aim to determine if there’s a disconnect—a decoupling—between policy intent and action for information asymmetry.

Part Three: Crafting Narratives in Quantitative History. By integrating quantitative analysis with historical context, I hope to shed light on the underlying forces shaping societal behaviors and decisions.
